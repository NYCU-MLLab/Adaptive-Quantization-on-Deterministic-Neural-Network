## Adaptive quantization neural network
Adaptive quantization neural network is a model that generalizes quantization models from binary to 'M'-ary. The representation values and quantization partitions are adaptively updated by end-to-end method. After the training, one might obtain an asymmetric quantizer which saves memory storage but conserves the classified accuracy.
## File description
"main_nonBayes.py" is the main file that runs adaptive quantization neural network.

"main_nonBayesbackup.py" is the main file that runs full precision model.

"utils" contains quantizaiton models and vanilla models.
